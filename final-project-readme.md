# Voice Controlled Car (VC Car)

Team: Calvin Tirrell, Jason Kwan, Kalyan Gautham

## Concept

We all may have used Remote Controlled Cars, which are controlled by a physical console. 
However, not everyone would be able to use their hands (owing to disabilities) for controlled these cars.
We have built Voice Controlled Car for these people. This car is controlled by voice commands.

## How does it work?



## How was it built?



## What works well?
1. The controller is well connected to the four motors
2. The car moves smoothly
3. The car takes 4 voice commands well in a quite environment even at a distance
4. The parts of the car are placed sturdily and stay intact during mild collusions.


## What didn't work as expected?
1. The voice commands are not recognized well when around a noisy environment
2. Raspberry Pi needs a stronger batter source which could not fit well on the chassis of the car. Hence, we used a power cord.
3. The voice commands do not recognize all accents.
4. There is a delay between the time the command is delivered by the user and the time the action is executed by the Pi.
