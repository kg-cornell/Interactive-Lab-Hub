#Voice Controlled Car (VC Car)

Team: Calvin Tirrell, Jason Kwan, Kalyan Gautham

#Concept

We all may have used Remote Controlled Cars, which are controlled by a physical console. 
However, not everyone would be able to use their hands (owing to disabilities) for controlled these cars. We have built Voice Controlled Car for these people. This car is controlled by voice commands.
